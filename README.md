# Creative Labs Portfolio Site

We held a series of portfolio building workshops throughout the course of 10 weeks. We taught members how to build app prototypes, UI designs and more. In the final week, we helped them code and push a portfolio site to GH Pages so they could showcase their work. This is a template site for those who did not design one on their own.
